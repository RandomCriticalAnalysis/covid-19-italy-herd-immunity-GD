For sero-prevalence by age, see abstract or table 1B of the following study:

For health-care workers, see figure 1A and compare with 7.5% for Lombardy generally, and 24% for Bergamo specifically (in both cases much higher in this study of health care workers):

It is worth noting that both findings are not unique to Lombardy or Italy. The relation between age and seropositivity is also found in e.g. Spain. Healthcare workers have higher seropositivity rates pretty much everywhere.

We thank these researchers and others for their efforts in mapping seroprevalence in these places and throughout Italy.
